Weather and Vacation API challenge


This script runs in two parts.

First, the weather data is collected for random cities around the world. \
Then, based on that data, correlations are measured to show relationships \
between different measurements (Latitude vs. temperature,humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed). \

In the second part, that same weather data is parsed to show the cities in the random set that have \
humidity less than 40% (I like when sweat can *actually* do its job), and looks for hotels in each of \
those cities.
